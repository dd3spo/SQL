#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

SELECT COUNT(Quantity) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID)=6
AND orderID <>'';

#2. shows how many of the orders where iphone

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT distinct acctnum 
FROM BIT_DB.customers c
JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON c.order_id=FEB.orderid
WHERE length(orderID)=6

#4. Shows The cheapest product in january and the price 
SELECT Product, MIN(price) as cheapest
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;
